Chess Project
==============
**Developer**: Tobias Washeim

I've played chess for many years, 
so I've always been interested in 
coding my own chess game. I'm 
developing multiple variations of 
the chess game. I'm planning the 
following gamemodes
- **AlphaChess**: A game mode where you 
have to kill the king to win. The setup
is like classical chess. But there's no
castling allowed, no checks on the king, 
and no en passant.
- **Pawn chess**: White starts with eight
pawns on the 2nd row. Black starts with 
eight pawns on the 7th rank. The first 
player to get a pawn on the 1st or 8th 
rank 3wins. 
- **Classical chess**: Normal chess with 
all the standard rules. 
- **Fischer chess** The figures are placed
in random order on the 1st and 8th rank. 
Everything else follows the standard rules
of classical chess.
- **Archer chess** Chess board is 8x10. 
White and black has two extra pawns and
two archers each. The archers can move one
square in each direction and shoot an 
arrow with a range of two squares. A move 
is used on either moving the piece or 
shooting. 
### Status on development
Currently developing and testing all the 
pieces
### Thoughts on future features
- Adding two buttons to surrender and
offer draw to opponent.
- Adding a clock with customizable times.
